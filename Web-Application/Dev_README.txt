How to start React

You will need to install the required libraries.
If you don't have "node.js: npm" already, install that first.

Once you can use "npm" command, follow the bottom step
1. In command prompt, "cd" into the directory "Web-Application"
2. Once in the directory, type "npm install" then press enter
3. This will install all the required files (node_modules)
4. Once it is done, type "npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap react-router-dom"
5. Once again it'll install the bootstrap used for the application.
6. Finally, you can type "npm start" to open up the developer server to view the application.
